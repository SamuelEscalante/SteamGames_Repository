```

2. Go to the project directory
```bash
  cd SteamGames_Repository
```

3. Create virtual environment for Python
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```

4. Start the virtual environment
```bash
  ./venv/Scripts/activate
```

5. Install libreries
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Create a configuration file named `credentials.json` in the project'sÂ rootÂ directory and add the following keys to the file:
```json
{

8. Create a database in PostgreSQL (Make sure it has the same name as your file `credentials.json`)}

9. Explore the project, you shoul start by folder **notebooks** :
   - _001_load_data:_  this notebook focused on initial data insertion into database
   - _EDA/002_raw_eda:_ this notebook is the Exploratory Data Analysis
   - _003_adicional_csvs:_ the output of this notebook is additional CSV files that are explained in the notebook and will be saved inside the `data` folder
